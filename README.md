## Enigma self-assesment

- For this project it went WAY better this time around than last time. When the project got announced i actually had an idea of how I was gonna approach and tackle this problem. Last time I felt like a fish out of water flopping around on land. This time I started making ideas in my head about how I was going to build this project. For the functionality I beilve i got a 3 due to the comamnd line interface working with both encrypting and decrypting. With object oriented programming I believe I got 2.75 because of my crypt method in my enigma class it seems very long but it is easy to read and goes smoothly down the line with the help of helper methods. I don't believe another class, module, or inheritance was needed since in my method it takes care of evertyhing. As for ruby convention and mehcanics I think 3 only because my crypt method is a longer than wanted but I fell for enumerables, methods, and how ideas are broken up it makes it look nice and clean. As for the testing I believe a 3 or 3.25 because mocks and stubs were used but also a coverage 0f &96.88 but due to two methods in which I wasn't sure mocks and stubs were usful or not. Overall this project went way better from last mod and shows how much I've grown using new techniques and understanding how to approach programming.
